# Chickpea and orange cake

## Ingredients


- 2 x 400g cans of chickpeas, rinsed well and drained
- 4 eggs, beaten
- 1 cup caster sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- Grated rind and juice from 1 orange (approx 50-100ml of juice)

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius
2. Grease or line a 450g loaf baking tin
3. Drain and rinse chickpeas throughly, then rub them between the palms of your hands to loosen and remove the skins
4. Put the de-skinned chickpeas in a food processor and blend until smooth
5. Combine pureed chickpeas, eggs, caster sugar, baking powder, ground cinnamon, orange juice and rind in a mixing bowl (this is a moist cake so the mixture will be quiet runny)
6. Pour the cake mixture into the loaf tin
7. Bake for 1 â€“ 1 1/4 hours, or until skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean
8. Remove from oven and let stand in tin for 10 minutes, then remove from tin
