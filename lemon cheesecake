Lemon Cheesecake


15 digestive biscuits, crushed
1/2 tablespoon light soft brown sugar 50g butter, melted
1 (250g) tub mascarpone cheese
1 (200ml) pot single cream
1 (397g) tin condensed milk
3 lemons, zested and juiced
Stir together the digestive biscuits, soft brown sugar and melted butter. Empty into a 23cm springform cake tin and press out level. Leave to chill in the fridge while you make the base. (Use a smaller tin if you want a thicker base.)
Mix together, really well, the mascarpone cheese, cream, condensed milk and lemon zest. Slowly add the lemon juice to the mix a wee bit at a time. I use an electric mixer and usually spend about 10 minutes mixing these ingredients together. I find the longer you mix, the thicker the topping gets in the bowl.
Pour onto your chilled base, then return to the fridge for a few hours for it to set.
